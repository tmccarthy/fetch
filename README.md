# Fetch

A library of tools I find myself writing for fetching data from the web. Includes:

* cats and fs2 based utilities for downloading and streaming data
* A rate-limiting backend for sttp
* A client for OpenStreetMap that can be used to geocode location strings
* A client for the data.gov.au API
* Caches using the local filesystem or a local Sqlite DB
